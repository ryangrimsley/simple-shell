# Simple Shell

A command line shell program(rysh) with some built-in command functionality. Built to teach myself more about some lower level Unix processes.

Coded with concepts mostly learned from this blog post: https://danishpraka.sh/posts/write-a-shell/, and this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubt-UjcQUYg&list=WL&index=3&t=701s.
